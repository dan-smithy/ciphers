ciphers
=======

Programs for enciphering/deciphering text using the atbash, caeser and vigenere ciphers. Advanced_vigenere is the same as vigenere, except instead of just using uppercase letters A-Z, it now uses 95 possible characters (ASCII codes 32-126).

Just follow the instructions given when the program is run. Note that these programs will only work in python3, and will also only work with with characters a-z (with the exception of the advanced_vigenere, which will use all ASCII characters from 32-126).
